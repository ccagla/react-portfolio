# React Portfolio App

This is a personal portfolio project built with **React** and **CSS**. It showcases my background, skills, and all the frontend projects I've built so far.

## Features

- **Component-based architecture** with reusable components
- **Responsive layout** for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- All projects are listed using a **custom ProjectCard component**
- Easy-to-update project data using a separate `data/projects.js` file
- Clean UI with semantic HTML and accessibility-friendly structure

## What I Learned

- React fundamentals: `Component`, `Props`, `JSX`
- How to organize a portfolio using reusable components
- Passing data with `props` and dynamic rendering with `.map()`
- File structure and styling in a React project
- Clean Git workflow with `.gitignore`, `.env` (for future projects), and proper commits


## Tech Stack

- **React**
- **CSS**
- **Vite** (build tool)
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)
